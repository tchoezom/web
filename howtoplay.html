		The rules to "Rock, Paper, Scissors" are pretty simple! The game will require two players.
		<br><br> Both players will repeat, "rock, paper, scissors, shoot", and on "shoot", both players will choose rock, paper, or scissors. "Rock" is shown by a fist. "Paper" is shown by an open hand. "Scissors" is shown by a peace sign. 
		<br><br>After both players put forward their hand, it is time to determine who the winner is. If both players chose the same sign, then it is a draw. Otherwise, paper beats rock by covering it, rock beats scissors by smashing it, and scissors beat paper by cutting it. That's it! Enjoy playing!
