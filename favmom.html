    <h2>My Favorite Moments</h2>
        
    <p> What particularly attracted me, along with many other readers, to this webtoon was the art style. Many would agree that the characters, scenery, and items are drawn very beautifully.

        I love the scene where Anthasia begs Claude for forgiveness even though she really did not do anything. I think the emotions are captured quite well.

        <br> Another one of my favorite scenes is this one, where Anthasia jokingly tries to contact Lucas, who has went away on a trip. They both look very beautiful and it is nice to see cute scenes like these. <br><br>
