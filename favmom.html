    <h2>My Favorite Moments</h2>
        
    <p> <br> What particularly attracted me to this webtoon was the art. The characters, scenery, and items are drawn very beautifully. To look at other works by this artist, click <a href="http://www.mangago.me/r/l_search/?name=Plutus">here</a>.
        I love the scene where Anthasia begs Claude for forgiveness even though she really did not do anything. I think the emotions are captured quite well.

        <br><br> Another one of my favorite scenes is this one, where Anthasia jokingly tries to contact Lucas, who has went away on a trip. They both look very beautiful and it is nice to see cute scenes like these.
