    <h2> Characters </h2>

        <br> <a href="https://who-made-me-a-princess.fandom.com/wiki/Lucas">Lucas</a> is a magician and Anthasia's friend. He takes care of Anthasia and although he comes off as intimidating due to his magical strength, he is the official companion of the crown princess.

    <h2> Plot </h2>
    
    <p> <br> This webcomic may seem confusing at first, but to a regular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhwa">manhwa</a> reader, the plot is not really anything that special. 
        <i> Suddenly Became a Princess One Day</i>, or otherwise known as <i> Who Made Me a Princess </i> is about a girl who reincarnates, or finds herself in a fictional story, <i> The Lovely Princess </i>, as the abandoned princess, Anthasia, of the Obelian Empire. 
        In the story she goes into, Athanasia was mercilessly executed by her ruthless father, Emperor Claude de Alger Obelia, for supposedly poisoning the princess, Jennette Margarita. 
        To change the outcome of the story and avoid death Athanasia tries her best to build an good relationship between herself and her new father, Claude, to survive.

    <h2>My Favorite Moments</h2>
        
    <p> <br> What particularly attracted me to this webtoon was the art. The characters, scenery, and items are drawn very beautifully. To look at other works of this artist, click <a href="http://www.mangago.me/r/l_search/?name=Plutus">here</a>.
        I love the scene where Anthasia begs Claude for forgiveness even though she really did not do anything. I think the emotions are captured quite well.

        <br> Another one of my favorite scenes is this one, where Anthasia jokingly tries to contact Lucas, who has went away on a trip. They both look very beautiful and it is nice to see cute scenes like these.
