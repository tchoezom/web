	  <li><b>Project Description</b></li>
	  <p>
	  	This is a program where the user can play a game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" with the computer.
	  </p>
	  
	  <li><b>Instructions</b></li>
	  <p>
		For the python version of "Rock, Paper, Scissors", the computer will first ask you if you need to read the rules and directions of how to play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" and you will type in "yes" or "no" accordingly. Next, it will ask you to choose rock, paper, or scissors, in order to play. You will type in your answer and the computer will also make a random choice. Based on your answer, the program will show what you chose, what the computer chose, and who won. If you want to play again, type in "yes" for the question, otherwise, type in "no". The program will ask you another question; if you want to see the data associated with the game, type in "yes" and take a look at the graph! After you are finished, and you want to go to the website with all this information, type in another "yes" and it will give you a link!
	  </p>
	  
	  <li><b>How It Works</b></li>
	  <p>
	  	By using the python function "input()", I can ask the user whether they would like to choose rock, paper, or scissors. The computer will always generate a random choice using the "choice()" function to randomly choose from the list of available choices. After storing each input value, the user's and the computer's, the program compares the two based on the rules of the game. Since rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock, I made conditional statements for each possible scenario, including ties! That was the play () function, which is the main game, but in case the user wants to play again, there is another function called replay () which takes input from the user on whether or not to play again. If yes, the function runs the play () function and restarts the game, otherwise, it moves on to the next portion. For the graph, there is a dictionary, called "rps_dict", which consists of real data that I collected myself, based on whether people were more likely to choose rock, paper, or scissors. In order to make the actual bar graph, I created a separate lists for each choice, and their respective lengths became the y-values (frequencies) for the graph.

	  <li><b>Files</b></li>
	  <p>
	  	RockPaperScissors.py : the main python file, that allows the user to access the rules of the game, play the game, access the graph, and also access the link to this website.

		<br><br>mystyle.css : the styling for this webpage

	  <li><b>Resources</b></li>
	  <p>
		  I thought it would be interesting to if people chose rock, paper, or scissors on their first play, so I conducted an experiment to see exactly that.
		  <br><br> With a group of 20 people, including myself, between the ages 15-16, I asked each person to play a game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" with me, and I recorded what they chose. My findings are summarized by the graph below (coded on python!) and show that the majority of the experimental group chose scissors! However, the number of people who chose each 'action' are very close in number, so the <i>randomness</i> of the game seems to be maintained pretty well!

		  The graph can also be accessed through the python file.

	  <li><b>Bugs, Errors and Things to be Aware of</b></li>
	  <p>
	  	Make sure that your spelling is correct at all times. The game will not work properly if you mistype, although you will be asked to reenter your answer.
		<br><br> Also, after the bar graph is generated in RockPaperScissors.py and you close it, you may type in your next answer to the question and disregard the graph. It will fully close after you type in your answer
