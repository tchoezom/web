	  <li><b>Project Description</b></li>
	  <p>
	  	This is a program where the user can play a game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" with the computer.
	  </p>
	  
	  <li><b>Instructions</b></li>
	  <p>
		For the python version of "Rock, Paper, Scissors", the computer will first ask you if you need to read the rules and directions of how to play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" and you will type in "yes" or "no" accordingly. Next, it will ask you to choose rock, paper, or scissors, in order to play. You will type in your answer and the computer will also make a random choice. Based on your answer, the program will show what you chose, what the computer chose, and who won. If you want to play again, type in "yes" for the question, otherwise, type in "no". The program will ask you another question; if you want to see the data associated with the game, type in "yes" and take a look at the graph! After you are finished, and you want to go to the website with all this information, type in another "yes" and it will give you a link!
	  </p>
	  
	  <li><b>How It Works</b></li>
	  <p>
	  	By using the python function "input()", I can ask the user whether they would like to choose rock, paper, or scissors. The computer will always generate a random choice using the "choice()" function to randomly choose from the list of available choices.
