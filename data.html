	<h2>DATA</h2>
<p>
	  It would be interesting to if people chose rock, paper, or scissors on their first play, so I conducted an experiment to see exactly that.
	  <br><br> With a group of 20 people, including myself, between the ages 15-16, I asked each person to play a game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" with me, and I recorded what they chose. My findings are summarized by the graph below (coded on python!) and show that the majority of the experimental group chose scissors! However, the number of people who chose each 'action' are very close in number, so the <i>randomness</i> of the game seems to be maintained pretty well!
	  <br><br> To further the study, I could ask people of different age groups and also analyze whether age or gender have any correlation to what they chose.

	  The graph can also be accessed through the python file!
