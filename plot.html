    <h2> Plot </h2>
    
    <p> <br> This webcomic may seem confusing at first, but to a regular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhwa">manhwa</a> reader, the plot is not really anything that special. 
        <i> Suddenly Became a Princess One Day</i>, or otherwise known as <i> Who Made Me a Princess </i> is about a girl who reincarnates, or finds herself in a fictional story, <i> The Lovely Princess </i>, as the abandoned princess, Anthasia, of the Obelian Empire. 
        In the story she goes into, Athanasia was mercilessly executed by her ruthless father, Emperor Claude de Alger Obelia, for supposedly poisoning the princess, Jennette Margarita. 
        To change the outcome of the story and avoid death Athanasia tries her best to build an good relationship between herself and her new father, Claude, to survive.
